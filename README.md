AngularJS directive for Highcharts

A simple Angularjs directive for Highcharts.

Current Version (0.0.6)
---------------

`<highchart id="chart1" config="chartConfig"></highchart>`

- See http://pablojim.github.io/highcharts-ng/examples/example.html for an extended example. Also Available in the example directory - thanks @crusat
- Basic example: http://jsfiddle.net/pablojim/Hjdnw/
- Example with dynamic x-axis: http://jsfiddle.net/pablojim/7cAq3/

The highchartsNgConfig resembles an exploded highcharts options object:


```javascript
highchartsNgConfig = {
             //This is not a highcharts object. It just looks a little like one!
             options: {
                 //This is the Main Highcharts chart config. Any Highchart options are valid here.
                 //will be ovverriden by values specified below.
                 chart: {
                     type: 'bar'
                 },
                 tooltip: {
                     style: {
                         padding: 10,
                         fontWeight: 'bold'
                     }
                 },
             },

             //The below properties are watched separately for changes.

             //Series object (optional) - a list of series using normal highcharts series options.
             series: [{
                 data: [10, 15, 12, 8, 7]
             }],
             //Title configuration (optional)
             title: {
                 text: 'Hello'
             },
             //Boolean to control showng loading status on chart (optional)
             loading: false,
             //Configuration for the xAxis (optional). Currently only one x axis can be dynamically controlled.
             //properties currentMin and currentMax provied 2-way binding to the chart's maximimum and minimum
             xAxis: {
              currentMin: 0,
              currentMax: 20,
              title: {text: 'values'}
             },
             //Whether to use HighStocks instead of HighCharts (optional). Defaults to false.
             useHighStock: false
             },
             //size (optional) if left out the chart will default to size of the div or something sensible.
             size: {
               width: 400,
               height: 300
             },
             //function (optional)
             func: function (chart) {
               //setup some logic for the chart
             }
```

All properties on the chart configuration are optional. If you don't need a feature best to leave it out completely - Highcharts will usually default to something sensible. Each property is watched for changes by angularjs.
NOTE:
A common error is to put other highcharts options directly into the highchartsNgConfig.
In general if the highcharts option you want isn't listed above you probably want to put it in highchartsNgConfig.options

Features:
---------

- Adding and removing series
- Setting/Updating Chart options
- Updating the chart title
- 2 way binding to chart xAxis
- Control of Loading status
- Resizes with screen size changes.


Caveats:
--------

- Due to many equality checks the directive maybe slow with large datasets
- Whole Chart/Series is often redrawn where a simple update of data would suffice
- If you don't assign ids to your series - incremental ids will be added
- The 2 way binding to xAxis properties should be treated as experimental
- When using with a highstocks navigator errors can occur
- Needs tests!
