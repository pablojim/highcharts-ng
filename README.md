AngularJS directive for Highcharts

A simple Angularjs directive for Highcharts.

Current Version
---------------

`<highchart id="chart1" config="chartConfig"></highchart>`

Basic example: http://jsfiddle.net/pablojim/Hjdnw/
Example with dynamic x-axis: http://jsfiddle.net/pablojim/7cAq3/

The chart config resembles an exploded highcharts options object:


```javascript
chartConfig = {
             //Main Highcharts options. Any Highchart options are valid here.
             //will be ovverriden by values specified below.
             options: {
                 chart: {
                     type: 'bar'
                 }
             },
             //Series object - a list of series using normal highcharts series options.
             series: [{
                 data: [10, 15, 12, 8, 7]
             }],
             //Title configuration
             title: {
                 text: 'Hello'
             },
             //Boolean to control showng loading status on chart
             loading: false,
             //Configuration for the xAxis. Currently only one x axis can be dynamically controlled.
             //properties currentMin and currentMax provied 2-way binding to the chart's maximimum and minimum
             xAxis: {
              currentMin: 0,
              currentMax: 20,
              title: {text: 'values'}
             },
             //Whether to use HighStocks instead of HighCharts. Defaults to false.
             useHighStocks: false
             }
```

All properties on the chart configuration are optional. Each property is watched for changes by angularjs.

Features:
---------

- Adding and removing series
- Setting/Updating Chart options
- Updating the chart title
- 2 way binding to chart xAxis
- Control of Loading status
- Resizes with screen size changes.


Caveats:
--------

- Due to many equality checks the directive maybe slow with large datasets (this is solvable though...)
- Whole Chart/Series is often redrawn where a simple update of data would suffice
- If you don't assign ids to your series - incremental ids will be added
- The 2 way binding to xAxis properties should be treated as experimental
- When using with a highstocks navigator errors can occur
- Needs tests!
